number: floating point numbers - used for integers ex. let age = 23;

String: sequence of characters - used for text ex. let firstName = 'Jonas';
// always use quotations for this
strings are always printed in white

Boolean: logical type that can only be true or false - used for decisions
ex. let fullAge = true;

undefined: Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined ('empty value')
ex. let children;

Null: Also means 'empty value'
will show up as object if used under typeof which is a bug. not fixed because of legacy reasons

Symbol (ES2015):Value that is unique and cannot be changed [not useful for now]

BigInt (ES2020): Larger integers than the 'Number type' can hold

//Javascript has dynamic typing: we do not have to manually define the data type of the value stored in a variable. Instead, Data types are determinede automatically.
js value has a type not the variable. they simply just store the type.

Use let when defining a variable at first but if you would like to change the value afterwards just type the variable without let and use =;
ex. let javascriptIsFun = true;
javascript = 'YES!'
